<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I am a recent graduate of Dartmouth College, where I majored in physics. My work experience includes Google Brain, CERN, Microsoft, and the DARPA Explainable AI Project. My goal as a researcher is to understand how learning happens and use it to make neural networks smarter and more interpretable. On a deeper level, I want to understand what intelligence is and how it works. So far, I am most proud of showing how to learn Hamiltonians from data, making RL agents more interpretable, and training RNNs to generate cursive handwriting. I care a lot about communicating my work and making it easy to replicate. Outside of research, I spend time with family and friends, run endurance races, and make things out of wood. Ask me about raising pigs.</p>

<p><em>“As water reflects the face, so one’s life reflects the heart.” — Proverbs 27:19</em></p>

<p>Before I belived in God, I tried to look calm and collected, but on the inside my mind was busy. I’ve always enjoyed learning about how the world works. So growing up, I spent a lot of time studying science. Over time, I came to believe that a person’s values and meaning in life are relative and should be constructed by each individual as they see fit. And so I endeavored to construct these things for myself. This cut me off from the people around me. And yet, the things I craved most were human connection, community, and the chance to have loving relationships. The more I lived according to my own rules, the more lonely and anxious I felt.</p>

<p>It was with this problem, which I couldn’t think myself out of, that I decided to go to church. I remember hearing a quote from Matthew where Christ says, <em>“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”</em> These words inspired me and I decided to put my faith in them. I started attending church each Sunday and joined a small group. This began a process of merging my love of science with a life of faith. I’d like to say that faith came to me all at once, but in reality it took me three years to get there. In all of that time, God was working in me: healing me, calming me, and transforming my view of the world. Going forward, life will have its ups and downs, but I have hope for the future, in Christ, come what may.</p>

<p>If you are looking to follow Christ, I would encourage you to read that quote from Matthew. It might take a long time, but no matter what, I can tell you that the search is worth it. In Christ there is a genuinely new life: one that involves real connection to other people, unconditional love, a meaningful existence, and the chance at redemption no matter who you are.</p>
