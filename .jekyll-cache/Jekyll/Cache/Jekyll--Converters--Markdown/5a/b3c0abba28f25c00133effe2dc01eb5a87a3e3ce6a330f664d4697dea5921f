  Dissipative HNNs (D-HNNs) output two scalar functions, denoted here with <b>H</b> and <b>D</b>. The first of these two, <b>H</b>, is the Hamiltonian. It is perfectly conserved. The second of these two, <b>D</b>, is the Rayleigh dissipation function. It models the dissipative component of the dynamics of a physical system. The addition of the dissipation function is what sets this model apart from Hamiltonian Neural Networks; it allows D-HNNs to model systems where energy is not quite conserved, as, for example, in the case of a damped mass-spring system.

<p>We are immersed in a complex, dynamic world where change is the only constant. And yet there are certain patterns to this change that suggest natural laws. These laws include conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. Taken together, they constitute a powerful simplifying constraint on reality. Indeed, physics tells us that a small set of laws and their associated invariances are at the heart of all natural phenomena. Whether we are studying weather, ocean currents, earthquakes, or molecular interactions, we should take care to respect these laws. And when we apply learning algorithms to these domains, we should ensure that they, too, take these laws into account.</p>

<p>Recent work has shown that neural networks can learn such symmetries directly from data using Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), Lagrangian Neural Networks, and a growing class of related models. But HNNs and LNNs both struggle when trained on datasets where energy is not conserved. In this post, we‚Äôll take a look at an extension of HNNs that can be trained on physics data where energy is not strictly conserved. We call this class of models ‚ÄúDissipative HNNs‚Äù and the core idea is use a neural network to parameterize both a Hamiltonian <em>and</em> a Rayleigh dissipation function. During training, the Hamiltonian is used to fit conservative (rotational) dynamics whereas the Rayleigh function is used to fit dissipative dynamics.</p>

  We live in a sea of change. But regardless of how a complex system's dynamics are, they can always be written as the sum of dissipative dynamics and conservative dynamics. By construction D-HNNs, are forced to learn these dynamics separately.

<p>Taken together, they represent an implicit Helmholtz decomposition. In other words, they can separate any vector field (representing, in this case, the dynamics of a physical system), into rotational and irrotational components. In the paper, we apply D-HNNs to synthetic mass-spring data, real world pendulum data, and real-world ocean current data. We‚Äôll show some of the highlights of those experiments in this post.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>The Hamiltonian \(\mathcal{H}(\textbf{q},\textbf{p})\) is scalar function such that
\(\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \textbf{p}} = \frac{\partial \textbf{q}}{dt},  -\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \textbf{q}} = \frac{\partial \textbf{p}}{dt}\)</p>

<p>The Rayleigh dissipation function $\mathcal{D}(\dot{\textbf{q}})$ is a scalar function that provides a way to account for generalized, velocity-dependent dissipative forces‚Äîsuch as friction‚Äîin the context of Hamiltonian mechanics \cite{cline2017variational}. Equation \ref{eq:lin-Dissipative} shows the Rayleigh function for linear, velocity-dependent dissipation. Here $\rho$ is a constant and $\dot q$ is the velocity coordinate.</p>

\[\mathcal{D} = \frac{1}{2}\rho\dot{q}^2\]

<p>Equation \ref{eq:nonlin-Dissipative} shows that nonlinear, velocity-dependent dissipation forces $F_i$ within the system can be accounted for as long as they are defined as 
\(F^{f}_i = -\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}(\dot{\textbf{q}})}{\partial \dot{\textbf{q}}}\)</p>
