<p>Before I belived in God, I tried to look calm and collected, but on the inside my mind was busy. I‚Äôve always enjoyed learning about how the world works and so growing up, I spent a lot of time studying science. Over time, I came to believe that a person‚Äôs values and meaning in life are relative and should be constructed by each individual as they see fit. And so I endeavored to construct these things for myself. This cut me off from the people around me. And yet, the things I craved most were human connection, community, and the chance to have loving relationships. The more I lived according to my own rules, the more lonely and anxious I felt.</p>

<p>It was with this problem, that I couldn‚Äôt think myself out of, that I decided to go to church. I remember hearing a quote from Matthew where Christ says, ‚ÄúAsk, and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.‚Äù These words inspired me and I decided to put my faith in them. I started attending church each Sunday and joined a small group. This began a process of merging my love of science with a life of faith. I‚Äôd like to say that faith came to me all at once, but in reality it took me three years to get here. In all of that time, God was working in me: healing me, calming me, and transforming my view of the world. Going forward, life will have its ups and downs, but I have hope for the future, in Christ, come what may.</p>

<p>If you are looking to follow Jesus, I would encourage you to read that quote from Matthew. It might take a long time, but no matter what, I can tell you that the search is worth it. Jesus offers you a genuinely new life: one that involves real connection to other people, unconditional love, a meaningful existence, and the chance at redemption no matter who you are.</p>
