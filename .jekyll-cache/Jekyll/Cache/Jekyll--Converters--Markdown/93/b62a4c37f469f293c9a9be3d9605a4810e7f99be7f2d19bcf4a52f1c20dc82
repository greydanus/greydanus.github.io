<p>In modern cities, the least expensive structural designs tend towards blocky, planar, and inorganic shapes. That is why we see warehouses and department stores built this way. If one is able to spare the cost, then the next best thing is to add some triangles. A pitched roof, perhaps with some dormers, makes a residential house far more inviting. Meanwhile, the most aesthetic residential houses, perhaps in craftsman or Victorian styles, have a great deal of ornamentation, sometimes curved, and sometimes evocative of the surrounding landscape. Buildings like churches, museums, and stadiums take these ideas even further and use organic-looking arrangements of arches, spires, and scaffolds to uplift the passerby.</p>

<p><strong>Form and function.</strong> In some ways, this tradeoff – the tradeoff between form (aesthetics) and function (which includes cost and reliability) – is as old as time. But in other ways, it has become sharper in the modern era as large-scale manufacturing and construction techniques have been optimized to save costs. This has led to a mass-production mentality which in turn has yielded structures with excessive uniformity. A Walmart in one city looks a lot like a Walmart in the next.</p>

<p>Yet the use of modern technology is not <em>intrinsically limited</em> to enabling mass production and enforcing uniformity. Certain technological tools can actually help to reduce the uniformity of the manmade environment and make it more inviting to the thoughtful pedestrian. One such tool is structural optimization.</p>

<p><strong>Structural optimization.</strong> Structural optimization permits us to express the constraints of structural design problems in general terms and then find organic-looking solutions to those problems in an open-ended manner. Just as no two trees are the same, no two structural optimization designs are either.</p>

<p>There are a number of companies that provide structural optimization services, but they do not open-source their code. Indeed, their code is often complex and highly technical. Academic researchers have produced a few <a href="http://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/Apps-and-software/Efficient-topology-optimization-in-MATLAB">high-quality tutorials</a> on the topic, but these tutorials are now a few decades old. Most of them, although well written, are aimed at readers with substantial domain knowledge. They obscure the fact that structural optimization is really quite simple, elegant, and easy to implement.</p>

<p>With that in mind, let’s write our own structural optimization code, from scratch, in 180 lines.</p>

<h2 id="problem-setup">Problem setup</h2>

<p>The goal of structural optimization is to place material in a design space so that it rests on some fixed points or “normals” and resists a set of applied forces or <em>loads</em> as efficiently as possible. To see how we might set this up, let’s start with a beam design problem from <a href="https://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/-/media/subsites/topopt/apps/dokumenter-og-filer-til-apps/topopt88.pdf?la=da&amp;hash=E80FAB2808804A29FFB181CA05D2EEFECAA86686">Andreassen et al (2010)</a>:</p>

<div class="imgcap_noborder" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:50%; min-width:300px;">
  <img src="/assets/structural-optimization/stopt_mbb_setup.png" />
</div>

<p>The large gray rectangle here represents the design space. We are going to enforce symmetry by optimizing half of the beam and then mirroring the result around the left wall. This means that the center of the beam is actually on the left side of the diagram. This is where the load force, denoted by the downwards-pointing arrow, is being applied. There are horizontally fixed points here as well. They represent forces transmitted to this half of the beam from its other half. Meanwhile, the vertically fixed point at the bottom right corner of the design space corresponds to a normal force from some external support, perhaps the top of a wall.</p>

<p><strong>Finite elements.</strong> Although the physics of elastic materials is continuous, our computer can only work with discrete approximations. This means that we have to cut the design space up into a discrete number of regions or <em>finite elements</em> which, when allowed to interact, reproduce the behavior of an elastic solid as realistically as possible. We can link their boundaries together with a set of nodes and allow these nodes to interact with one another as though connected by springs. This way, whenever a force is applied to one node, it transmits a fraction of that force on to all the other nodes in the structure, causing each one to move a small amount and, in so doing, deform the finite elements. As this happens, the entire structure deforms as though it were an elastic solid.</p>

<p>There are many ways to choose the arrangement of these finite elements. The simplest one is to make them square and organize them on a rectangular grid.</p>

<div class="imgcap_noborder" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:50%; min-width:300px;">
  <img src="/assets/structural-optimization/stopt_design_domain.png" />
</div>

<p>In the diagram above, there are 12 elements with four nodes per element and two degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node. The first is horizontal and the second is vertical. The numbering scheme proceeds columnwise from left to right so that the horizontal and vertical displacements of node \(n\) are given by DOFs \(2n-1\) and \(2n\) respectively. As the authors point out, this grid structure is useful because it can be exploited “…in order to reduce the computational effort in the optimization loop…” It also simplifies the code.</p>

<p><strong>Python representations.</strong> Given this problem setup, every DOF in our design space can either have a force applied to it or be fixed by a normal. For a design space that is \(y\) units high and \(x\) units wide, we can represent these parts of the problem setup with NumPy arrays called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forces</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">normals</code>, each of shape \((y+1,x+1,2)\). Here the first two axes index over all the nodes in the design space and the third axis indexes over the two DOFs available to each node. Starting with the code below – and continuing throughout the rest of this tutorial – we are going to flatten these arrays to one dimension.</p>

<p>There are a few other important details. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mask</code> variable can be either a scalar of value 1 (no mask) or an array of shape \((x,y)\). As a default, we will use no mask. Then there are all the material constants, constraints, filter widths, and so forth to consider. For these, we use the values reported by Andreassen et al. (2010). Finally, we have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mbb_beam</code> function which sets up the forces and normals particular to the MBB beam design constraints. This function can easily be swapped out if we wish to design a structure with different constraints.</p>

<p><strong>The density method.</strong> Now that we have parameterized the design space, it is time to parameterize the material that moves around on it. At a high level, each finite element is going to have a certain density of material, given by some number between 0 and 1. We will use this density to determine the element stiffness coefficient \(E_e\), also called Young’s modulus. In the nodes-connected-by-springs analogy, this coefficient would control all the spring constants.</p>

<p>Let’s discuss how to choose the mapping between finite element density \(x_e\) and Young’s modulus in more detail. First of all, we’d like to avoid having any elements with zero stiffness. When this happens, they stop transmitting forces to their neighbors before optimization is complete and we are liable to end up with suboptimal solutions. We can prevent this by giving each finite element a baseline stiffness, \(E_{min}\), regardless of whether it has any material density.</p>

<p>We’d also like black-and-white final solutions. In other words, although our design space may start out with material densities of 0.5, by the end of optimization we’d like all of the grid cells to have densities very close to either 0 or 1. We can ensure this happens by raising our densities to a power \(p\) greater than one (typically \(p=3\)) so as to make our structure’s stiffness more sensitive to small changes in density.</p>

<p>Putting these ideas together, we obtain the “modified SIMP” equation from Andreasson et al. (2010):</p>

<p><span id="longEqnWithSmallScript_A" style="display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;">
\(\begin{align}
E_e(x_e)=&amp;E_{min} + x^p_e(E_0-E_{min}) \\
&amp; x_e \in [0,1]
\end{align}\)
</span>
<span id="longEqnWithLargeScript_A" style="display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;">
\(E_e(x_e)=E_{min} + x^p_e(E_0-E_{min}), \quad \quad x_e \in [0,1]\)
</span></p>

<p>Here \(E_0\) is the stiffness of the material. For a comparison between modified SIMP and other approaches, see Sigmund (2007).</p>

<p><strong>Filtering.</strong> Finally, in order to avoid grid-level pathologies (especially scenarios where a grid element with full density ends up next to a grid element with zero density and a discontinuity occurs), we are going to use a 2D Gaussian filter<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to smooth the grid densities. This technique, called “filtering,” shows up in almost all physics simulations where continuous fields have to be discretized.</p>

<p>At this point, we have constructed a finite element parameterization of an elastic solid. We are applying forces to this solid in some places and supporting it with fixed points in others. As it deforms, it stretches and compresses in proportion to the stiffness of its finite elements. Now the question we need to ask is: <em>what does the best structure look like under these conditions?</em></p>

<h2 id="the-objective-function">The objective function</h2>

<p>At a high level, the best structure is the one that minimizes the elastic potential energy or <em>compliance</em> of the 2D grid of springs. We can express this idea mathematically as follows:</p>

<p>Here \(c\) is the compliance, \(\mathbf{x}\) is a vector containing the material densities of the elements, \(\mathbf{K}\) is the global stiffness matrix, \(\mathbf{U}\) is a vector containing the displacements of the nodes, and \(E_e\) is Young’s modulus. The external forces or “loads” are given by the vector \(\mathbf{F}\).

<h2 id="computing-sensitivities">Computing sensitivities</h2>
<p>The objective function gives us a single number, \(c(\mathbf{x})\), which we can use to rate the quality of our structure. But the question remains: <em>how should we update \(\mathbf{x}\) so as to minimize this number?</em> To answer this question, we need to compute the gradients or <em>sensitivities</em> of \(c\) with respect to \(\mathbf{x}\). These sensitivities will give us the direction to move \(\mathbf{x}\) in order to decrease \(c\) as much as possible. Ignoring filtering for a moment and applying the chain rule to the first line of the objective function, we obtain</p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial x_e} &amp;= -px_e^{p-1}(E_0-E_{min})\mathbf{u}_e^T\mathbf{k}_0\mathbf{u}
\end{align}\]

<p>If we want to add filtering back in, the notation becomes a bit more complicated. But we’re not going to do that here because, actually, we don’t need to calculate these sensitivities by hand. There is an elegant little library called <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a> which can do this for us using a process called <em>automatic differentiation.</em> The basic syntax looks like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import autograd.numpy as anp   # Thinly-wrapped version of Numpy
from autograd import grad

def dot_product(u, v):
  return anp.dot(u, v)

grad_dot_product = grad(dot_product)  # obtain the gradient function by way of Autograd

u = anp.asarray([2,2,2.])
v = anp.asarray([1,2,3.])
print( "Gradient w.r.t. u is: ", grad_dot_product(u,v))
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gradient w.r.t. u is:  [1. 2. 3.]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Custom gradients.</strong> There are a few cases where we need to operate on NumPy arrays with functions from other libraries. In these cases, we need to define a custom gradient function so that Autograd knows how to differentiate through them. For example, in the code we have already written, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gaussian_filter</code> function comes from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scipy</code> library. Here’s how we can wrap that function to make it work properly with Autograd:</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-physics">Implementing the physics</h2>
<p>In between \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(c(\mathbf{x})\), there are a series of physics functions that we still need to implement.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance.</strong> At a high level, the compliance is just \(\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{K}\mathbf{U}\). But \(\mathbf{U}\) and \(\mathbf{K}\) are very sparse so it’s much more efficient to calculate \(\sum_{e=1}^NE_e(x_e)\mathbf{u}_e^T\mathbf{k}_0\mathbf{u}_e\). That’s what we will do in the code below. It’s a little hard to follow because everything is vectorized (hence the einsums) but this does speed things up considerably compared to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop.</p>

<p><strong>The element stiffness matrix.</strong> The variable \(\mathbf{k}_0\) that appears in the compliance calculation is called the element stiffness matrix. An intuitive way to think about this matrix is as a 2D analogue of the spring constant \(k\) in a simple harmonic oscillator. The reason it is a matrix (instead of a scalar or a vector) is that we need to take into account all of the various interaction terms between the corner nodes in a square finite element.<sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> When we represent the displacement of all these nodes with a vector \(u=[u^a_1,u^a_2,u^b_1,u^b_2,u^c_1,u^c_2,u^d_1,u^d_2]\), then it becomes easy to calculate the potential energy of the system: we just write \(PE = \frac{1}{2}u^Tk_0u\) (this is the 2D analogue to the potential energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator, which is written as \(\frac{1}{2}kx^2\)).</p>

<p>From this you should be able to see why compliance is the potential energy of the entire structure: it’s just a sum over the potential energies of all the finite elements. You should note that each term in the sum is getting scaled by a factor of \(E_e(x_e)\). This is happening because the stiffness matrix varies with Young’s modulus, and we have made Young’s modulus dependent on the local material density.</p>

<p><strong>Material constants.</strong> You’ll notice that two material constants appear in the element stiffness matrix. The first is Young’s modulus which measures the stiffness of a material. Intuitively, it is the distortion per unit of force (“How hard do you need to pull a rubber band to stretch it one inch?”). A more technical definition is <em>the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain</em>. The Poisson coefficient, meanwhile, measures the amount of contraction in the direction perpendicular to a region of stretching, due to that stretching (“How much thinner does the rubber band get when you stretch it one inch?”). A technical definition is <em>the ratio between the lateral contraction per unit length and the longitudinal extension also per unit length.</em> Both of these coefficients come into play when we construct the element stiffness matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Calculating displacements.</strong> Now we need to tackle one of the most important physics problems: calculating the displacements of the nodes. The way to do this with a 1D spring would be to solve the equation \(F=kx\) for \(x\). Here we can do the same thing, except by solving the matrix equation \(\mathbf{F=KU}\). For a system with \(N\) nodes with 2 degrees of freedom each, the matrix \(\mathbf{K}\) will have dimensions \(2N\) x \(2N\). This gives us a system of \(2N\) simultaneous linear equations for \(2N\) unknown node displacements.</p>

<p><strong>A global stiffness matrix with \(N\) nodes.</strong> The number of nodes  \(N\) grows as the product of the width and height of our design space. Thus it is not unusual to have over \(10^4\) nodes in a design space. Since the size of  \(\mathbf{K}\) grows as \(N^2\), it quickly becomes too large to fit in memory. For example, using \(10^4\) nodes and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">np.float32</code> data format, we get a \(\mathbf{K}\) matrix that consumes 1.6 GB of RAM. Increasing its width and height by 50% increases that number to 8 GB. This is not a sustainable rate of growth!</p>

<p>Luckily, since our nodes are locally-connected, most of the entries in \(\mathbf{K}\) are zero. We can save a vast amount of memory by representing it with a sparse “coordinate list” or COO format. The purpose of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_k</code> function below is to assemble just such a matrix. If you want to see all the details for how this matrix is constructed, read the “global stiffness matrices with \(N\) nodes” section of <a href="http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter7_2/Chapter7_2.htm">this textbook chapter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The sparse matrix solve.</strong> Having constructed \(\mathbf{K}\), all we have left to do is solve the system of equations. This is the most important part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">displace</code> function. It uses Scipy’s SuperLU function (which supports COO) to solve for nodal displacements without ever instantiating a \(2N\) x \(2N\) matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Sparse matrix helper functions.</strong> You may notice that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">displace</code> function uses a helper function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_get_dof_indices</code>, to update \(\mathbf{K}\)’s indices. The point here is to keep only the degrees of freedom that were actually free in the problem setup (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">freedofs</code>). To do this, we need to remove the degrees of freedom where normal forces were introduced (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixdofs</code>).</p>

<p>The second function is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inverse_permutation</code> function. It is a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InversePermutation.html">mathematical operation</a> that gives us the indices needed to undo a permutation. For example, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ixs</code> is a list of indices that permutes the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>, then this function gives us a second list of indices <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inv_ixs</code> such that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A[ixs][inv_ixs] = A</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Custom gradients for a sparse matrix solve.</strong> Our sparse solve, like our 2D Gaussian filter, comes from the Scipy library and is not supported by Autograd. So we need to tell Autograd how to differentiate through it. To do this, we’ll copy a few lines of code from <a href="https://github.com/google-research/neural-structural-optimization/blob/1c11b8c6ef50274802a84cf1a244735c3ed9394d/neural_structural_optimization/autograd_lib.py#L188">this Google Research repo</a>.</p>

<p>These lines are similar to <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/blob/96a03f44da43cd7044c61ac945c483955deba957/autograd/numpy/linalg.py#L40">Autograd’s implementation</a> of the gradient of a matrix solve. The main difference is that whereas the Autograd version is written for dense matrices, this version is written for sparse matrices. The underlying mathematical idea is the same either way; see “<a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/NA-08-01.pdf">An extended collection of matrix derivative results for forward and reverse mode algorithmic differentiation</a>” by Mike Giles for the relevant formulas.</p>

<p>And with that, we are done with the physics! Now we are ready to set up the optimization itself.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>To do this, we’ll use the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). Originally described by Svanberg (1987) and refined in <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.146.5196&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Svanberg (2002)</a>, MMA is a good fit for structural optimization problems because it accepts nonlinear inequality constraints and scales to large parameter spaces. In the code below, we rewrite the mass conservation constraint as a mass <em>threshold</em> constraint so that it looks like an inequality. Then we set the density constraint by giving upper and lower bounds on the parameter space. Finally, we use Autograd to obtain gradients with respect to the objective and pass them to the solver. The NLopt package makes this process pretty straightforward. Also, its <a href="https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/#mma-method-of-moving-asymptotes-and-ccsa">documentation</a> gives some good practical advice on how to think about MMA.</p>

<p>Other optimization approaches we tried included optimality criteria (by Andreasson et al. 2010), plain gradient descent, LBFGS, and the Adam optimizer. Consistent with the findings of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04240">this paper</a>, MMA outperformed all these approaches.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing-a-gazebo-roof-support">Optimizing a gazebo roof support</h2>
<p>This is a slightly more challenging and interesting task. The problem setup was taken from a real-world gazebo rafter design problem.
Dimensions: 16’ wide by 4’ high; 2:1 roof pitch
Fixed points: Horizontal beam across bottom of region (fix x and y), Vertical center beam (fix x and y)
Forces:
Dead load: 12-17 psf, live load: 25psf, snow load: 10psf, wind load (down): 10psf, wind load (up): 4psf
Net angle of forces: Sum vertical forces: 15 (-4 wind) -&gt; use 15, Sum perpendicular (to roof) forces: 25 + 10 -&gt; 35
This implies 30% of force is directed vertically &amp; 70% of force is directed perpendicular to roof
Angle of net force is approximately 20 degrees (0.349 radians)</p>

<p>There are many, many more structures in <a href="https://arxiv.org/src/1909.04240v2/anc/all-designs.pdf">this supplement</a> from Hoyer et al. 2019. The problem setups are all listed <a href="https://github.com/google-research/neural-structural-optimization/blob/1c11b8c6ef50274802a84cf1a244735c3ed9394d/neural_structural_optimization/problems.py">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts-">Closing thoughts 🌆</h2>

<p>In sci-fi representations of healthy cities of the future, we often find manmade structures that are well integrated with their natural surroundings. Sometimes we even see a convergence where nature has adapted to the city and the city has adapted to nature. The more decadent cities, on the other hand, tend to define themselves in opposition to the patterns of nature. Their architecture is more blocky and inorganic. And when they do have organic-looking structures, those structures are reminiscent of the dangerous elements of nature: fangs, claws, volcanoes, and caves.</p>

<p>Perhaps tools like structural optimization can help us build the healthy cities of the future – while steering clear of the decadent ones.</p>
