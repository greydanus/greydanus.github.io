<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>I am a recent graduate of Dartmouth College, where I majored in physics. My work experience includes Google Brain, CERN, Microsoft, and the DARPA Explainable AI Project. My goal as a researcher is to understand how learning happens and use it to make neural networks smarter and more interpretable. On a deeper level, I want to understand what intelligence is and how it works. So far, I am most proud of showing how to learn Hamiltonians from data, making RL agents more interpretable, and training RNNs to generate cursive handwriting. I care a lot about communicating my work and making it easy to replicate. Outside of research, I spend time with family and friends, run endurance races, and make things out of wood. Ask me about raising pigs.</p>
