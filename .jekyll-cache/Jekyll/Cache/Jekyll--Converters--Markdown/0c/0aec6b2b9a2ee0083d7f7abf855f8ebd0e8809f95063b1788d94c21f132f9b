<p>How does a single fertilized egg grow into a population of 70 trillion cells ‚Äì a population that can walk, talk, and even write sonnets? This is one of the great unanswered questions in biology. We may never finish answering it; indeed, the mere asking of it should be tempered with a certain degree of humility. But it is a productive question. By asking it, scientists have discovered the structure of DNA, sequenced entire genomes, and even edit the genetic material of living organisms. Because of them, we can interact with the building blocks of life in ways our ancestors could scarcely have imagined.</p>

<p>Thanks to new methods in computer science, we are now able to study this question with finer granularity than ever before. We can simulate entire populations of cells and allow them to interact with one another. These interactions, which are purely local in nature, can ultimately produce complex structures at the population level. In fact, we can even use a new class of models called Neural Cellular Automata to <em>solve for</em> the rules of growth that produce specific ‚Äúorganisms.‚Äù</p>

<p>Some rules of growth are extremely simple. Consider, for example, the growth of an icicle as additional layers of water freeze to its exterior. In this case, we can see that the icicle‚Äôs growth is just proportional to its surface area. Another example is the growth of a bank account‚Äôs balance due to compound interest. There are simple equations taht we can use to predict this growth to a high degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>The rules of cellular growth are another matter. Cellular growth involves not only increase in size, but also changes in form and specializations in cell function. Consider how a little green bud grows into an exquisite rose blossom. In just a few days, the bud may quadruple in size, change colors, and burst into a variety of specialized organs including petals, stigmas, filaments, and ovaries. In the example of the rose, the rules of cellular growth are not easy to model. There are hundreds of special cases that cells must follow depending on where they are located on the flower. Are you located on a petal? Produce a great deal of red pigment. Are you located on the stem? Reinforce your cell walls with cellulose to provide structural support. Some cells will need to grow fast, others will need to grow slow, and some others may even need to undergo apoptosis ‚Äì programmeed cell death ‚Äì in order to bring about the final structure.</p>

<p>It should be clear by now that writing out the rules that govern how a bud transforms into a rose</p>

<p>We can simulate large populations of cells and the way they interact with each other at the local level in order to give rise to global, large-scale structure</p>

<p>We can simulate large populations of cells and, in particular, the local interactions between neighboring cells, which give rise</p>

<p>What do we mean by growth? In the most straightforward definition, growth is increase in size. For example, we might say that an icicle grows as additional layers of water freeze to its exterior. Or we might say that a bank account grows due to compound interest. These sorts of growth are easy to model and we should be surprised if our predictions are incorrect.</p>

<p>Cellular growth is another matter. It involves not only change in size, but also change in form and differentiation of structure. Consider how a little green bud transforms into a colorful and elaborate flower. In just a few days, the bud may quadruple in size, change in color, and burst into a variety of specialized organs including petals, stigmas, filaments, and ovaries.</p>

<p>The remarkable thing about cellular growth is that it is wholly self-organized. No single cell or group of cells choreographs the process. Most of the time, cells only interact with their immediate neighbors. And yet the sum of these local interactions is a population with global structure at a scale which is orders of magnitude larger than any single cell.</p>

<p>When multicellular organisms grow, they not only increase in size; they also also undergo dramatic changes in form and structure.</p>

<p>Consider how a little green bud transforms into a colorful and elaborate flower. Not only does it change in size as it grows; it also changes in form and outward appearance. Different groups of cells differentiate to perform specific tasks.</p>

<p>Most mathematical studies of growth are unable to contend with the complexity and nuance of biological systems. If they study these systems at all, it is in aggregate. They might report the average height of a boy as a function of his age. But making sense of the complex biological processes which cause him to grow the way he does is another matter entirely. How does a cluster of cells differentiate into an embryo? And from there, how does that small cluster of cells coordinate with each other as their population grows from a few thousand to over 70 trillion?</p>

<p>It is not for us to understand the full complexity of human growth and development. But on a smaller scale, new machine learning methods are letting us simulate biological growth with small, simplistic populations of cells. In these situations, we start with a grid of pixels and imagine that each pixel is actually a cell. Then we simulate interactions between these cells and their neighbors, producing, over time, a complex self-organizing system which can give rise to large-scale structure.</p>

<h2 id="simulating-populations-of-cells">Simulating populations of cells</h2>

<p>We say that each cell has four visible attributes: red, blue, green, and transparency. Each cell also has a set of invisible attributes; this set can vary in size, but we can think of each to these attributes as the concentration of a particular protein at that particular cell‚Äôs location. Each of these simulated cells can only observe its status and that of its neighbors. And from these observations, it can alter its observable attributes (red, green blue, and alpha channels) and its hidden attributes (local protein gradients).</p>

<p>In this experiment we simulate bone growth. Bone growth is interesting because it uses apoptosis (programmed cell death) in order to produce a hollow area in the center of the bone. We see something analogous happen in our model, with a circular tan frontier that gradually expands outwards until it reaches the size of the target image.</p>

<p>Train a neural CA that can grow from a seed pixel into one of three different flowers depending on initial value of the seed. From a dynamical systems perspective, we are training a model that has three different basins of attraction, one for each flower. The initial seed determines which basin the system ultimately converges to. The initial seed vs. the shared attractor dynamics are analogous to the DNA of a specific flower vs. the shared cellular dynamics across related flower species.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>There is a counterintuitive possibility that in order to explore the limits of how large we can scale neural networks, we may need to explore the limits of how small we can scale them first. Scaling models and datasets downward in a way that preserves the nuances of their behaviors at scale will allow researchers to iterate quickly on fundamental and creative ideas. This fast iteration cycle is the best way of obtaining insights about how to incorporate progressively more complex inductive biases into our models. We can then transfer these inductive biases across spatial scales in order to dramatically improve the sample efficiency and generalization properties of large-scale models. We see the humble MNIST-1D dataset as a first step in that direction.</p>
