I"<p>To the followers of Plato, the world of the senses was akin to shadows dancing on the wall of a cave. The essential truths and realities of life were not to be found on the wall at all, but rather somewhere behind you, in the form of real dancers and real flames. Aristotle echoes this idea, writing “We must advance…towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature.” It was by living in this philosophical tradition that Newton himself discovered hidden structure in the movements and interactions of the world around him. “I do not know what I may appear to the world” he wrote, “but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”</p>

<p>The idea that there are secret truths scattered around us – some of them in plain sight – is an animating spirits of our intellectural tradition. With it comes a sense of humility and the willingess to doubt one’s initial impressions. In modern times, it is tempting to abandon this perspective owing to how far technology has progressed. We might reason, with some evidence, that we have discovered the great secrets of science and charted all the furthest reaches of the globe. True, there is some seafloor yet to be charted and some scientific ideas to be <em>refined</em> but what if the great discoveries are behind us?</p>

<p>“Physics is not about how the world is” wrote Niels Bohr, “it is about what we can say about the world.” His departure from the Aristotelian worldview was intentional, for he was responding to experimental evidence of quantum mechanics. The data suggested that either locality (the idea that causal interactions only occur directly, and not at a distance) or realism (the idea that all objects have definite states which exist whether or not they are being observed) was a faulty assumption</p>
