Hello everyone,

Few things distinguish life at a hotel from life at home more than a good continental breakfast. This was the small novelty with which we began our day: a spread consisting of scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, fruits, and bagels. Airbnbs improve over hotels in most dimensions: convenience, charm, cost, and often cleanliness. Most of us book Airbnbs when we travel these days. But a great casualty of this trend has been those lost thirty minutes of the mid-morning when you can linger over a full plate of breakfast food, a steaming cup of coffee, and plan out your day. All with the secret satisfaction that it is _complimentary_.

It was fortunate that we had a hearty breakfast this morning because shortly thereafter we kicked into high gear. Splitting ourselves into various cars, we headed to the Simon Fraser University satellite campus in Surrey. I will admit that I had never heard of Simon Fraser before this trip. SFU is not particularly well known for sports, or unusually proficient in a niche academic subject, or influential as a cultural center (they are younger and smaller than the University of British Columbia). I knew that they were a good school, but I did not suppose them to be a _distinguished_ school. So it was with surprise and delight that I learned today that they excel - they are truly proficient - at one thing. Quoting one of the responses I got yesterday from you, my readers:

_"They have a rocking bagpipe band from that university. We competed against some of their younger talent. They are known across the world for being a Grade 1 pipe band, best of the best. I think they’ve won world championships a few times."_

It's unhealthy for one person or institution to try and be the best at everything. But I love finding out that a person or group has some secret talent, some hidden gift. Especially [bagpipes](https://youtu.be/UfQqo10EHPE?t=140). I think that God must feel the same way, otherwise why would he give us hidden gifts -- gifts that sometimes we don't even know we possess? Why would he pick out characters like Abraham (had trouble leaving the nest), Moses (bad at public speaking), and David (the youngest son) to lead the Israelites?

Anyways, we all met up at the SFU campus and prayed with Pastor Matt Johnson, the new campus minister [photo 1]. He told us about the campus and how his fledgling church is going to fit in with it. Then we walked around the campus in small groups and prayed. We only talked to a few students today and all of them are currently involved in the new SFU church. Our main goal was to encourage them and plant some seeds of faith through prayer and fellowship.

After our main work for the day was finished, we attended the ENC Vancouver church for Sunday Service [photo 2]. The service was in the evening because they are renting the space from another congregation. But as you can see, the building itself is beautiful. There is a high pitched roof which creates a wide open, vertical space in the main sanctuary. The large wooden beams angle sharply downwards and end in elegant curves towards the vertical. And the stained glass windows are not overstated; they bring just enough colored light into the room to evoke a sense of warmth and beauty.

The sermon today was on Acts 8:26-40 which recounts how Philip met an Ethiopian eunuch. It's a strange story. One that I hadn't read in a long time. Basically, Philip is wandering in the desert when, quite by chance (or rather, providence) he comes across a fairly well-to-do Ethiopian eunuch. This man is starving for God but for some reason (probably because he's an Ethiopian and a eunuch) he has been unable to converse with many Christians to understand Scripture. So all Philip has to do is ask him one or two simple questions before he starts begging to get baptized: _"And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?'" (Acts 8:36)._

I am praying that tomorrow, when we're out on the SFU campus again, I'll meet someone who has that kind of hunger for God. I'd appreciate your prayers as well. I suspect that there are students on these campuses who are hungry for spiritual connection in the same way that the Ethiopian was. And up here, unlike out in the desert, there is plenty of water...

Much love from Canada -

Sincerely,

Sam
