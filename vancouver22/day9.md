Hello everyone,

Tonight is our last night in BC. On this trip, I've grown to think of my teammates as family; tonight I'll be skipping my regular voluminous update in order to spend extra time with them.

So, ironically, this is an update to tell you that there will be no update. Some interesting things happened today and I will touch on them in tomorrow's update.

Much love from Canada -

Sincerely,

Sam
