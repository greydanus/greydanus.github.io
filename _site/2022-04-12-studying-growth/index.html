<!-- ## A Productive Question -->

<p>How does a single fertilized egg grow into a population of seventy trillion cells – a population that can walk, talk, and write sonnets? This is one of the great unanswered questions of biology. We may never finish answering it, and indeed, the mere asking of it should be tempered with humility. But it’s also a productive question. Scientists who have asked this question over the past seventy years have discovered the structure of DNA, sequenced the human genome, and made essential contributions to modern medicine. In this post, we will ask this question using a new tool called Neural Cellular Automata (NCA).</p>

<!-- **Neural Cellular Automata.** A few years ago, scientists showed that it is possible to use neural networks to represent the rules for how simulated cells interact with one another. This allowed them to teach simulated cells to interact with one another at a local scale in order to produce complex emergent behaviors at the population level. So far, only a few papers have been written about these "Neural Cellular Automata" models. One reason is that they are a relatively new idea. Another reason is that, although they require expertise in ML to implement, their main intellectual appeal is to an audience interested in cellular morphogenesis. The intersection of people who are comfortable in both worlds is relatively small.

But the mechanics of cellular morphogenesis are extremely important. Indeed, NCA may be the best long-term means of understanding the programming language of our bodies' cells. If DNA is the source code that comes pre-installed on your computer, then cellular morphogenesis is the complex and varied means by which your computer performs its functions: booting up, decompressing files, creating pop-up windows, and so forth. In order to understand your computer as a whole, it makes a lot of sense to start by studying the mechanics of these everyday functions.

With all of this in mind, let's take a closer look at how NCA work and then apply them to some simple biology problems. -->

<h2 id="neural-cellular-automata">Neural Cellular Automata</h2>

<p>The purpose of cellular automata (CA) is to mimic biological growth at the cellular level. Most CAs begin with a grid of pixels with each pixel representing a different cell. Then a set of growth rules, which control how each cell responds to its neighbors, are applied repeatedly to the population. Although these growth rules are simple to write down, scientists generally choose them so as to produce complex, self-organizing behaviors. Conway’s Game of Life, for example, has just three simple growth rules but can give rise to diverse structures and dynamics.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Classic versions of cellular automata like the Conway’s Game of Life are interesting because they produce emergent behavior by way of very simple rules. But in a way, these versions of CA are <em>too simple</em>. Their cells only get to have two states, dead or alive, whereas biological cells get to have a near-infinite number of states, states which are determined by a wide variety of signaling molecules. We refer to these molecules as <em>morphogens</em> because they work together to control growth and guide organisms toward specific final shapes or <em>morphologies</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A more flexible framework.</strong> Based on this observation, we should move away from cells that are only dead or alive. Rather, we should allow cells to exist in a variety of states, with each state defined by a list of continuous variables. Growth rules should operate on combinations of these variables in the same way that biological growth rules operate on combinations of different morphogens. And unlike Conway’s Game of Life and other classic CAs, the self-organizing behaviors that arise should not be arbitrary. Rather, they should involve convergence to <em>specific</em> large-scale morphologies like those that occur in biology. As you might imagine, this requires much more complex growth rules.</p>

<div class="imgcap_noborder" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:100%">
  <img src="/assets/studying-growth/comparison.jpg" />
</div>

<p>The diagram above shows how NCA take a step in the right direction. Unlike regular cellular automata, they represent each cell state with a real-valued \(n\)-dimensional vector and then allow arbitrary growth rules to operate on that domain. They do this by <em>parameterizing growth rules with a neural network and then optimizing the neural network to obtain the desired pattern of growth</em>. To showcase the model’s expressivity, the authors trained it to arrange a population of a 1600 cells in the shape of a lizard using purely local interactions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-notebook">Getting started (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13wCM9OV2JR004zFvh7zPgUxrga8sU4d1">notebook</a>)</h2>

<p>The first step to studying growth with Neural Cellular Automata is to obtain a high-quality, hackable, and minimalist implementation. The authors of the original paper released a series of excellent Colab notebooks which show how to implement NCA in TensorFlow. But after experimenting with their code, I decided to reimplement everything in PyTorch. I like PyTorch better and I wanted to make a minimalist implementation that would be easy to hack on in order to try out new ideas. You can find it <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13wCM9OV2JR004zFvh7zPgUxrga8sU4d1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Having replicated the results of the original paper, I decided to scale the model to see whether it could grow larger and more complex “organisms.” I soon discovered that the population size was going to be limited by the amount of RAM on my Colab’s GPU. I maxed things out with a population of about 7500 cells running for about 100 updates. For context, the original paper used a population of 1600 cells running for 86 updates.</p>

<p>Working in this scaled up regime, I trained my NCA to grow into three different flowers: a rose, a marigold, and a crocus. Some of the early results were a bit mangled, but before long I was able to grow a little garden composed of these three flowers. You can do the same by clicking the “Play” buttons in the diagram at the top of this post.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-of-biological-growth">Patterns of biological growth</h2>

<p>Biological growth is wonderfully diverse. Although the same basic cellular mechanics are at work in a gnat and a blue whale, their end results are far different from one another. Consider this passage from the first chapter of <em>Growth</em> by Life Science Library:</p>

<p><em>A eucalyptus native to Uganda has been known to grow 45 feet in two years, whereas dwarf ivy generally grows one inch a year. The majestic sequoia of California, which starts out as a seed weighing only one three-thousandth of an ounce, may end up… [with a] weight estimated at 6,200 tons. It takes more than 1,000 years for the sequoia to achieve the feat of multiplying 600 billion times in mass. The animal kingdom, too, has its champions of growth. The blue whale, which cruises the oceans from the North to the South Pole, begins life as a barely visible egg weighing only a fraction of an ounce. At birth, it weighs from two to three tons. When it is weaned, at about seven months, it is 52 feet long and weighs 23 tons, having gained an average of 200 pounds a day.</em></p>

<p>Given the extraordinary diversity of life forms on our plane, one of the biggest surprises might actually be how much they have in common. For the most part they have the same genetic materials, signaling pathways, enzymes, and metabolic pathways. Their cells have the same life cycles. And they share the same abstract patterns of growth even though their final forms are quite different. Let’s look at some concrete examples of these patterns and see whether we can train NCA that reproduce them.</p>

<h3 id="1-gnomonic-growth"><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DUFL5glyej725r8VAYDZIFrWvpR6a6-0">1. Gnomonic growth</a></h3>

<p>One shared pattern of growth is called <em>gnomonic growth</em>. This pattern tends to occur whenever an organism’s shape is defined by a rigid structure, and yet that organism needs to keep increasing in size. You can see this dilemma in clams, for example. Their shells are rigid and there is no way to deform them. And yet those shells need to increase in size as the organism inside of them grows. Clams solve this problem by incrementally adding long crescent-shaped lips to the edge of their shells. Each new lip is just a bit larger than the one that came before it. These lips, or <em>gnomons</em> as they are called, permit objects to increase in size without increasing in form. They are a pattern of growth that shows up in shells, horns, tusks, and other rigid objects such as tree trunks.</p>

<p>One of the most famous products of gnomonic growth is the nautilus shell. In this shell, each gnomon increases in size relative to its neighbor in a very consistent manner. This happens with such granularity that the shell is often used as an example of fractals – or patterns which look the same at different scales of space or time – in biology.</p>

<p>Grow a Nautilus shell. The neural CA learns to implement a fractal growth pattern which is mostly rotation and scale invariant. The technical term for this pattern is <em><a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/waR6eVCQ">gnomonic growth</a></em>.</p>

<p>In this experiment we simulate bone growth. Bone growth is interesting because it uses apoptosis (programmed cell death) in order to produce a hollow area in the center of the bone. We see something analogous happen in our model, with a circular tan frontier that gradually expands outwards until it reaches the size of the target image.</p>

<p>Train a neural CA that can grow from a seed pixel into one of three different flowers depending on initial value of the seed. From a dynamical systems perspective, we are training a model that has three different basins of attraction, one for each flower. The initial seed determines which basin the system ultimately converges to. The initial seed vs. the shared attractor dynamics are analogous to the DNA of a specific flower vs. the shared cellular dynamics across related flower species.</p>

  <li>Studying developmental diseases</li>

  <li>Virtual worlds with visual programming languages</li>
  <li>Physics simulations</li>
</ul>

<p>Romantic and beautiful introduction; channel Phil Anderson &amp; More is different; talk about <em>simplicity</em>. Close by saying that we need to analyze how exactly these models work; how the self-organization occurs mechanistically. There is a counterintuitive possibility that in order to explore the limits of how large we can scale neural networks, we may need to explore the limits of how small we can scale them first. Scaling models and datasets downward in a way that preserves the nuances of their behaviors at scale will allow researchers to iterate quickly on fundamental and creative ideas.</p>

<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>

<!-- _Now two organisms are exactly alike. Each grows and develops in a unique fashion within the limits that its environment permits. Every species, however, has its own way of growing, and each has its own rate of growth. The range of variations is overwhelming. In as little as three months, for example, one of the grasses native to tropical Ceylon, a bamboo, may shoot up to a height of 120 feet, as tall as a 12-story building, by growing at an average rate of 16 inches a day. A eucalyptus native to Uganda has been known to grow 45 feet in two years, whereas dwarf ivy generally grows one inch a year. The majestic sequoia of California, which starts out as a seed weighing only one three-thousandth of an ounce, may end up 270 feet tall, with a base diameter of 40 feet and a weight estimated at 6,200 tons. It takes more than 1,000 years for the sequoia to achieve the feat of multiplying 600 billion times in mass._

_The animal kingdom, too, has its champions of growth. The blue whale, which cruises the oceans from the North to the South Pole, begins life as a barely visible egg weighing only a fraction of an ounce. At birth, it weighs from two to three tons. When it is weaned, at about seven months, it is 52 feet long and weighs 23 tons, having gained an average of 200 pounds a day. By the time it reaches maturity, in about 13 years, the blue whale is serious competition for many submarines. Then it may weight more than 85 tons and exceet 80 feet in length._ -->

<!-- 
Just as there is a shared but invisible structure -- based on Newtonian physics -- that underlies the motion of the planets or of a falling apple, so too there is shared structure to the growth rules of multicellular organisms. Of course, it's harder to reduce this structure to a clean set of equations than in physics. There are more exceptions and special cases. But since it reoccurs in diverse and unrelated biological organisms, there is good reason to believe that we can reproduce it in simulations of multicellular systems.
