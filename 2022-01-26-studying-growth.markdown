<!-- ## A Productive Question -->

How does a single fertilized egg grow into a population of seventy trillion cells -- a population which can walk, talk, and even write sonnets? This is one of the great unanswered questions of biology. We may never finish answering it; indeed, the mere asking of it should be tempered with a certain degree of humility. Nevertheless, it is a productive question. By asking it over the course of the past seventy years, humans have discovered the structure of DNA, sequenced the human genome, and transformed modern medicine.

In this post, we will use cellular automata to look at one aspect of this question: namely, how basic patterns of biological growth are implemented at the cellular level. We will begin by simulating a large population of cells and letting them to interact with one another. Then, by experimenting with the rules that govern their interactions, we will first replicate certain patterns of biological growth and then try to figure out how they are implemented.

As you may have gathered, cellular automata are a simple algorithmic method of simulating biological cells. The basic idea is to represent a population of cells with a grid of pixels, letting each pixel stand in for a cell. Then we choose a set of growth rules which determine how adjacent cells interact with one another. These rules tend to be quite simple; Conway's Game of Life, for example, has just three rules. But this setup, as simple as it sounds, can give rise to surprisingly complex emergent patterns.

The problem with this kind of cellular automata is that it is too simple. Cells only get to have two states: dead or alive. Biological cells, on the other hand, have non-binary states which are determined by a vast array of genetic material, enzymes and signaling protiens. In order to model them properly, we should switch to a list of scalar values representing all the various concentrations of enzymes and signaling protiens in a given cell. We should also allow for more expressive growth rules, rules which can vary according to all of these different factors.

An important step in this direction is Mordvintsev et al.'s [Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca) (NCA) model. In this model, they represent each cell state with an n-dimensional vector of scalar values and then allow arbitrary growth rules to operate on this expanded domain. To accomplish this in practice, _they parameterize the NCA's growth rules with a neural network and then optimize them using gradient descent_. Using this approach, they obtain an NCA that can grow from a single cell into a large population of cells in the shape and color of a lizard emoji.

## Simulating populations of cells

Even more importantly, NCA allow us to find growth rules that lead to specific population patterns. These patterns may have complicated large-scale shapes and textures (like the flower patterns at the beginning of the blog) and the simulated cells will still be able to grow into these patterns using purely local, and sometimes noisy, interactions.

We say that each cell has four visible attributes: red, blue, green, and transparency. Each cell also has a set of invisible attributes; this set can vary in size, but we can think of each to these attributes as the concentration of a particular protein at that particular cellâ€™s location. Each of these simulated cells can only observe its status and that of its neighbors. And from these observations, it can alter its observable attributes (red, green blue, and alpha channels) and its hidden attributes (local protein gradients).

### [**Simulating populations of cells**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TgGN5qjjH6MrMrTcStEkdHO-giEJ4bZr#scrollTo=k-2PCTfGI-pq)
Grow a 64x64 flower using the code in this GitHub repo. Scales up to 70x70 and hundreds of timesteps, which is nearly double the size of the model published in Distill. Flower options include `rose`, `marigold`, and `crocus` as shown in the lead image of this README.

### [**Healing tissues with self-organization**](https://colab.research.google.com)
Look at neural textures, taking images and videos from Distill article

### [**Orchestrating growth with embryonic induction**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fbakmrgkk1y-ZXamH1mKbN1tvkogNrWq)
We grow an image of a newt and then graft its eye onto its belly during development. We do this in homage to [Hans Spemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Spemann) and his student Hilde, who won a Nobel Prize in 1935 for doing something similar with real newts. Need to modify the experiment so that some transplanted skin cells are able to induce growth of a second eye on the newt's belly.

### [**Building rigid structures with gnomonic growth**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DUFL5glyej725r8VAYDZIFrWvpR6a6-0)
Grow a Nautilus shell. The neural CA learns to implement a fractal growth pattern which is mostly rotation and scale invariant. The technical term for this pattern is _[gnomonic growth](https://www.geogebra.org/m/waR6eVCQ)_.

### [**Apoptosis: using death to form the living**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qQcztNsqyMLLMB00CVRxc0Pm7ipca0ww?usp=sharing)
In this experiment we simulate bone growth. Bone growth is interesting because it uses apoptosis (programmed cell death) in order to produce a hollow area in the center of the bone. We see something analogous happen in our model, with a circular tan frontier that gradually expands outwards until it reaches the size of the target image.

### [**Directing growth with genetic material**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vG7yjOHxejdk_YfvKhASanNs0YvKDO5-)
Train a neural CA that can grow from a seed pixel into one of three different flowers depending on initial value of the seed. From a dynamical systems perspective, we are training a model that has three different basins of attraction, one for each flower. The initial seed determines which basin the system ultimately converges to. The initial seed vs. the shared attractor dynamics are analogous to the DNA of a specific flower vs. the shared cellular dynamics across related flower species.

## Closing thoughts

There is a counterintuitive possibility that in order to explore the limits of how large we can scale neural networks, we may need to explore the limits of how small we can scale them first. Scaling models and datasets downward in a way that preserves the nuances of their behaviors at scale will allow researchers to iterate quickly on fundamental and creative ideas. This fast iteration cycle is the best way of obtaining insights about how to incorporate progressively more complex inductive biases into our models. We can then transfer these inductive biases across spatial scales in order to dramatically improve the sample efficiency and generalization properties of large-scale models. We see the humble MNIST-1D dataset as a first step in that direction.
