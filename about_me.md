## About me

I am a software engineer and researcher (Google Brain, DARPA, CERN, and Dartmouth College). I currently work for a startup called [Windscape AI](https://windscape.ai/) and run a small rental company called Greenfield Properties. This is my research blog, where I write posts about topics that interest me, or highlight actual papers I've written.

My research interests vary but often involve the intersection between physics -- one of the oldest and most theoretical fields of science -- and ML -- one of the youngest and most data-oriented. I often build new things by combining established tools and ideas in creative ways. Examples include [Hamiltonians & neural networks](../2019/05/15/hamiltonian-nns/), [structural optimization & Autograd](../2022/05/08/structural-optimization/), and [biological morphogenesis & CNNs](../2022/05/24/studying-growth/).

* 2013 – Physics major, Dartmouth College
* 2015 – Particle physics intern, CERN
* 2016 – Software engineering intern, Microsoft
* 2017 – Co-captain of US team, International Physicist's Tournament
* 2018 – Google AI Resident, Google Brain San Francisco
* 2019 – Deep learning researcher, Oregon State and [The ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/)
* 2022 – Physics and ML at [Windscape AI](https://windscape.ai/). Owner at Greenfield Properties.
