## About me

I'm a software engineer and researcher (Google Brain, DARPA, CERN, and Dartmouth College). I currently work for a Series B startup called [Humata Health](https://www.humatahealth.com/) and run a small rental company called Greenfield Properties. This is my research blog. I write posts about topics that interest me and highlight papers I've written.

My research interests tend to involve the intersection between physics -- one of the oldest and most theoretical fields of science -- and ML -- one of the youngest and most data-oriented. I like to build new things by combining established tools and ideas in creative ways. Some examples include [Hamiltonians & neural networks](../2019/05/15/hamiltonian-nns/), [structural optimization & Autograd](../2022/05/08/structural-optimization/), and [biological morphogenesis & NCAs](../2022/05/24/studying-growth/).
