## About me

I am a software engineer and researcher (Google Brain, DARPA, CERN, and Dartmouth College). I currently work for a startup called [Windscape AI](https://windscape.ai/) and run a small rental company called Greenfield Properties. This is my research blog, where I write posts about topics that interest me and highlight papers I've written.

My research interests vary but often involve the intersection between physics -- one of the oldest and most theoretical fields of science -- and ML -- one of the youngest and most data-oriented. I like to build new things by combining established tools and ideas in creative ways. Some examples include [Hamiltonians & neural networks](../2019/05/15/hamiltonian-nns/), [structural optimization & Autograd](../2022/05/08/structural-optimization/), and [biological morphogenesis & NCAs](../2022/05/24/studying-growth/).

* 2013 – Physics major, Dartmouth College
* 2015 – Particle physics intern, CERN
* 2016 – Software engineering intern, Microsoft
* 2017 – Co-captain of US team, International Physicist's Tournament
* 2018 – Google AI Resident, Google Brain San Francisco
* 2019 – Deep learning researcher, Oregon State and [The ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/)
* 2022 – Physics and ML at [Windscape AI](https://windscape.ai/). Owner at Greenfield Properties.

## Why is this website mostly black and white?

Much of the internet is optimized for engagement. As a result, navigating websites can be an overwhelming and subtly stressful experience. Consider color. Color is a wonderful part of the natural world, but bright reds and yellows show up sparingly. Like salt and herbs, they are garnishes that enhance the taste of a dish but are not meant to be the dish itself. Thus it is vaguely impolite for a website to use bright, gaudy colors in its theme. And yet it's inevitable because that's what attracts attention.

Another related point is that camera photos tend to demand more attention than simple diagrams or sketches. I do not know the subtle fen shui behind this, but try this thought experiment: imagine you walk through a house full of windows, each one looking out on a different scene. It would be interesting, but distracting. You'd want to look through each window as soon as you came upon it. Tasteful pictures and wall hangings are more toned down; they let you walk through the house without having your attention pulled here and there so aggressively. Later, at your leisure, you can rest your eyes on them and find something to appreciate.


In making this blog I have rebelled against tendencies towards too much color and too many real photos. I've sought to keep the theme modest enough that the sensitive reader can relax while he or she explores it. I cannot attest to how others feel about it, but I enjoy the theme and that's a good first step.
